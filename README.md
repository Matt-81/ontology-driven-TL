Data and resources for FOIS2020 paper: Ontology-Driven Cross-Domain Transfer Learning - https://fois2020.inf.unibz.it/

### Processes 
This folder contains the two main components used in the experiment: 
-> property predictor
-> class predictor

The two xml file can be run within the RapidMiner Framework: https://rapidminer.com/

For the set-ip of the feature extractor component please chek RapidMiner extension like http://splab.cz/en/download/software/immi-rapidminer-extenison 

### Ontologies
This folder contains the ontologies used in the experiment, i.e., the "Household" and "Travel" ontologies. 
Converting the given ontologies into a set of triples and filtering the triple by the "Domain" predicate it is possible to derive the matrices used to train the class predictor and to annotate each example of the image dataset.
